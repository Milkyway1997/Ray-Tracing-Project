# Ray-Tracing-Project

I completed this ray-tracing project back to the time when 
I took the computer graphics course at Miami University in 2019. 

To try this project, you can download the Ray-Tracing-Project
folder and run the 'CSE287Raytrace.sln' file in Visual Studio 2019. 

You will see the scenes shown in the screenshots folder. 
Keys you can press to change the scene:

-Recursion deep: 0-5

-Lights: a, p, d, s

-Reflecting Sky: y

-Day Time: m

-Night Time: n

-Camera view: g, h, j

-Antialiasing: z

PS: Since this used a ray-tracing algorithm, 
it will be very lagging when you run the program.
