# Ray-Tracing-Project

I completed this ray-tracing project back to the time when I was taking the computer graphics course at Miami University in 2019.

Scene:

To try out this project, you can download the Ray-Tracing-Project folder and run the 'CSE287Raytrace.sln' file in Visual Studio 2019.

You will see the many scenes as shown in the screenshots folder. Here are some keys you can press to change the scene:

➢ Recursion Deep: 0-5

➢ Lights ON/OFF: a, p, d, s

➢ Reflecting Sky ON/OFF: y

➢ Day Time: m

➢ Night Time: n

➢ Change Camera view: g, h, j

➢ Antialiasing: z

PS: Since this project used the ray-tracing algorithm, running the program will be very laggy.
